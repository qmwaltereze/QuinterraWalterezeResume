        <p class="lead mb-4">I like writing essays. Here's as sample from one: Glaucon's Challenge to Socrates<br><br>

        Of the many arguments that take place in Plato‚Äôs Republic, there is the interesting one of Glaucon‚Äôs challenge. When Glaucon asks about what type of good justice is, Socrates answers that justice is the type of good that is both good in and of itself as well as for the sake of other things. He thinks a person can find happiness living in this kind of justice. Glaucon disagrees, arguing that justice can only be good for the sake of other things finding that, when given the chance, anyone will pick a life of doing injustice over the other. To satisfy himself, Glaucon challenges Socrates to tell him what justice is and prove to him how justice is good for its own sake and how life in the pursuit of justice is better than one in the pursuit of injustice. But before I can dive into either argument of Glaucon or Socrates, it is important to first understand what is meant by the term ‚Äújustice‚Äù; and, even before that, what is meant by something ‚Äúbeing good for its own sake.‚Äù
        So, what does it mean for something to be good for its own sake? In Book II of the Republic, Glaucon offers that ‚Äúthere is a kind of good we welcome, not because we desire what comes from it, but because we welcome it for its own sake‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 998, 357b). 
        Think of a stranger stopping a woman for directions. She doesn‚Äôt point him the right way expecting a reward for her help, nor does she owe him or hopes to grow her reputation through him; rather, she does it because she wants to or is happy to do so, and for no other reason than that. Then, for something to be good in this way is for it to give nothing back, other than what it intrinsically is. That being said, something good for the sake of another thing, like medicine or  money, would then be good for the advantage that that thing brings, like health or whatever money buys. This is the distinction seen between Socrates‚Äô and Glaucon‚Äôs argument.
        Now, looking at justice, Glaucon presents the common view that most people hold. He describes justice as a sort of social contract that individuals enter into, upholding it out of necessity instead of good ‚Äúbecause they are too weak to do injustice with impunity‚Äù and would rather not have to suffer it themselves (Plato, Republic, 1000, 359b). Glaucon explains that this is the essence of justice in that people are not willingly just but only pretend to be because they fear being caught and punished for being otherwise. Once these terms are understood, it‚Äôs easier to see the basis on which Socrates must respond to Glaucon's challenge. 
        Glaucon puts forth the argument that justice is only good for the sake of not experiencing injustice and that if put in a situation of which relieves a person of fearing consequences, anyone will act unjustly. He expands upon this idea through the story of The Ring of Gyges, in which a ring can turn its wearer, Gyges, invisible. He continues, pointing out that ‚Äúwhen [Gyges] realized this...he seduced the king‚Äôs wife, attacked the king with her help, killed him, and took over the kingdom‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1000, 360b). It is with this that Glaucon makes his point. People lacking in power abide by justice whereas those who have it do injustice. If allowed to enact injustice with impunity, then anyone who can; will. Take, for example, a king like the one from the story. The king‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisibility‚Äù is his divinity. From this, he receives immunity in acting unjustly against his people, or his court, or his family. He is the definition of power and, for the most part, has no fear of facing any consequences. And next to him, let‚Äôs say, stood a commoner who has no entitlement to immunity. If the king spits on him, the man will have to bear it. If the man spits on his king, though, he might find himself beheaded. Glaucon decides that if there were two rings for both the just and unjust man, then the commoner would spit on his king and maybe even pants him too. He concludes that no one in their right mind would live justly if ‚Äúevery man believes that injustice is far more profitable to himself than justice‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1001, 360c).<br><br>
        
        In hearing Glaucon‚Äôs argument, Socrates forms a rebuttal for him; though, in a rather unusual way, as Socrates attempts to guide Glaucon to his idea of justice through two methods. First, Socrates submits the analogy of the city. Tasked with finding justice in both the city and a single man, Socrates begins his search in the city as the city, being the bigger thing, would be easier to identify justice in ‚Äúafterwards [looking] for it in the individual, observing the ways in which the smaller is similar to the larger‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1008, 369a). Secondly, Socrates utilizes the concept of a deductive argument positing that a premise structured to be true, would logically follow its conclusion to be true as well. Think about it like this: if all humans are mortal and all mortals fear death, then if Socrates is human, he fears death! With this strategy, Socrates can construct his response to Glaucon, having the former method act as a blueprint to better explain the components that constitute his idea of justice while the latter links this justice to values found in what will come to be known as the tripartite soul.
        Book IV of the Republic, is where Socrates shares his response to Glaucon‚Äôs challenge. He states that justice, seeking a sort of harmony, can also be good for its own sake without requiring its participants to live in utter misery. Introducing the city, Socrates notes the three parts to be the guardians, the rulers who give wisdom and watch over the city; the auxiliaries, the warriors who protect the city and are obedient to the guardians, following them; and the workers, the money-makers, and the largest part of the city responsible for making all the service that the city needs under the watch of the guardians and auxiliaries (Plato, Republic, 1073, 442a). In this, Socrates observes something about the city, in that when ‚Äúeveryone must practice one of the occupations in the city for which he is naturally best suited‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1064, 433a)  ‚Äúmore plentiful and better-quality goods are more easily produced‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1009, 370c). Essentially, what this means is that when everyone cooperates in doing their role the city is stronger for it. Imagine a lion pride in the case of the city where the females hunt, the children play, and the male protects them all. Here, like the city, the pride is strong, fed, protected, and therefore, survives. From the analogy of the city, Socrates poses that the tripartite, or the three parts of the soul: appetite, spirit, and rational, work in the same way. That is to say when reason controls appetite and the spirited follows reason then the soul is in a state of harmony (Plato, Republic, 1072-1073, 441a,e-442b). This is what Socrates claims justice to be, the harmony of the three parts of the soul working together. But even if justice is a sort of harmony how then, is this good for its own sake?<br><br>

        If we keep in mind Socrates‚Äô second method and apply it here, then an answer should find us by the end of this. Let‚Äôs take a look at the appetite of the soul. According to Socrates, appetite is the desire of the soul. If a person is thirsty, for example, appetite compels them to drink and compels them to eat when they are hungry and to sleep when they are tired. ‚ÄúBut thirst itself will never be for anything other than what it is in its nature to be for, namely, drink itself, and hunger for food‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1069, 437e). From the fact that appetite gives nothing other than what it seeks, it can be said that desires of the appetite are good for their own sake. Moving on to rational, let‚Äôs go back to the example of thirst. Even though appetite‚Äôs only interset is to satisfy itself, in this case with its desire for drink, one could make to say that a thirsty person might not always want to drink. And in order to forbid that person from drinking because the water is dirty or whatever it may be, rational takes control of appetite. For what reason then, does rational have to forbid appetite from drinking if not purely out of a rational calculation (Plato, Republic,1070, 439c,d). Through this, rational and appetite are the same. Finally, let‚Äôs come to observe the last part of the soul, the spirited part. It is seen that the spirit is the emotional part of the soul but it is also seen that it follows the rational part. Falling back to the common view of justice, if the spirit finds itself being treated unjustly rational will lead it to be vengeful. Whereas if it finds that it has done wrong and is punished justly rational tells the spirit not to be so (Plato, Republic, 1072, 440c,d). In this connection, spirit is similar to rational and by extension, the appetite as well. Therefore, all parts of the soul are good for their own sake. Taking this a step further, it has previously been found that all parts of the soul work together in harmony. If justice is a sort of harmony, which Socrates thinks that it is, then it follows logically that justice is good for its own sake. Since justice holds this truth it is ‚Äúsomething to be valued by anyone who is going to be blessed with happiness‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 999, 358a). It‚Äôs contrary to this that injustice leads to dysfunctionality within the soul. Such can be seen in a pride of lions of whose members switch roles or enter into positions for which they are not suited for. For if the male lion takes the position of his lionesses then he would starve them all by nature of him being slower or outnumbered by his prey or enemies and neglect the cubs in his inexperience as a caregiver. The soul of an unjust person reacts in this way, tearing itself apart. To pursue a life of injustice seems to be a terrible idea because ‚Äúeven if one has every kind of food and drink, lots of money, and every sort of power to rule, life is thought to be not worth living when the body‚Äôs nature is ruined‚Äù (Plato, Republic, 1076, 445b).
        When we understand Socrates‚Äô argument in its entirety, I say he has a great response to Glaucon‚Äôs challenge. Furthermore, he is right in his case that justice is good for what it is and for what it brings. This is true, simply for the reason that he answers Glaucon‚Äôs challenge in fullness and with sense. Glaucon has all the information he needs to know about what Socrates thinks justice to be, why it is good for its own sake, and why it‚Äôs better than a pursuit of injustice. I especially enjoyed how Socrates came to his conclusion of justice being good by itself through his craft of deductive arguments. Given all this, Socrates has decidedly beaten Glaucon‚Äôs challenge.
